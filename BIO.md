Hey, YSaude, Dehy here. Here is where I talk about me.  
Think of this as an extended bio as opposed to my typical Discord bio, my typical pronouns.page bio, and heck, even my Demirramon's Hideout bio, all of those which you can see via my Linktree (except for Discord).  

___

So my most common internet alias is DehydratedWater. But what does that mean? And more importantly, where did I get that alias from?  
Well, that starts back to a couple of years ago, when my older brother had made an alternate account on his Xbox One (I believe it was a Series X at the time), of which was called "HydratedIce". It was either his own funny lil' idea or something funny that the auto-generator for usernames came up with. Either way, it was somewhat funny because of the unnecessary detail of the "Ice" being "Hydrated".  

So, if it wasn't obvious enough, my brother's Xbox alt "HydratedIce" was the inspiration for "DehydratedWater". But, then... when did I start using it?  
We'll obviously not be able to get an exact date, and especially not an exact time, but we can narrow down what could be the first platform I used the alias "DehydratedWater" on.  

The only account on the Linktree that has been named "DehydratedWater" for more than one year as of writing this is my character.ai account. When I was looking around for this part of my bio, I hadn't realised that my character.ai account was named "DehydratedWater". In fact, I'm very confident that this account is the very first instance of my alias from me. Eventually, it would spread a little. Of course, not too much, only over to my Discord and other miscellaneous platforms. "DehydratedWater" and "Dehy" would then be my go-to usernames from every platform onward.  

Okay, so now that's all cut and dry, what about the meaning? What does "DehydratedWater"... mean? Well, to clear up, it's 1. Obviously the polar opposite of "HydratedIce", and 2. Doesn't... exist? Kinda? Like, you can't really exactly have dehydrated water. Even if you could, it would just evaporate, because, well, it needs water. If water needs water, it can't be water because it doesn't have water in the first place. Wow, that's a lot of water. This is why the infamous "DEHYDRATED WATER" can that I use on basically all of my "DehydratedWater" account says to "fill in the water yourself".  

___

Well, that was a whole lot of yapping about my username. Let's talk about my REAL NAME now, hm?  
The closest thing most people have to my name is Kris S. Yup, that's it. That's literally all I have to say about my real name.  

___

So, if it wasn't obvious enough, I love to write. Well, kind of. It's more like I love to write about one certain thing. Like, an idea for a game, or, well, myself like I'm doing now, how I love to write, if you want to get more specific about it.  

I actually LOVE to think about ideas for something, whether it be dialogue for a hypothetical situation in a videogame, or an entire game itself. No kidding, I have somewhere around 10 text files that are just an idea about something! In fact, one of those files, labelled "PONKLES the Videogame" (I'll let you figure that one out), is 33 whole kilobytes! Now, that may sound like nothing to you, and I don't blame you, but only ONE of my other text documents are even somewhere CLOSE to reaching that file size!  

To give a clearer sense of size, this file is, get this: 33,746 characters (with spaces) long! That. Is. RIDICULOUS.  

___

Speaking of ideas for games, one of them is actually (slowly) coming true as we speak! I'll briefly talk about it here, it's an idea for a Roblox game with multiple genres that has a meta premise. It's being developed by three people at the moment; me, a dev friend of mine, and a friend of theirs. I give plenty of ideas, make loads of concept art, and make music*, while my dev friend and their friend both program, make the maps, and make the art involved. That's all I'm telling you about this game, because anything more would just be mere spoilers...  

___

*Hey, remember that asterisk from earlier? I bet you did, and if you didn't? Then, uhh. There goes all of my money, I guess. Anyways, yeah, I make music. But where do I put that music? And how do I even make it? Well, I COULD answer those questions with one word each, and those words are...  

Scratch. Beepbox.  

Now for the actual answers; while I have been starting a habit of actually putting my music on SoundCloud, most if not all of my music can be found on Scratch, with my Scratch main and alt, ScratchMaster09771 and ScratchMasterAlt respectively. (And before you even start wondering, I am nowhere near a master at Scratch. Same kind of thing applies to my previous Nintendo Switch main username "GameMaster". Don't know why I wanted to mention that, but I felt the need to mention it, so there, I guess.)  

As for where I make my music, I make it over on Beepbox, an online website where you can create music, with basically unlimited possibilities!... Most of which are not great.  

But I don't use BEEPBOX directly. I actually use a MOD of it, which there are loads of for Beepbox.  
At the moment, I'm using Abyssbox, a mod of Ultrabox, of which Ultrabox is a combination of a bunch of other mods that were for Beepbox.  
So it's a mod, of a combination of other mods, of Beepbox. Actually, I think there was one more seperate mod in the mix, but I'm not sure if that's the case, and I'm not sure what the mod was.  

___

Now, this bio has been a lot of talking about me. Selfish, I know, but I think it's time I briefly talk about some of my close online friends! No introduction whatsoever.  

I'm glad that me and Gnatt happened to cross paths on Demirramon's Hideout. When Gnatt is on, it's basically always a fun time. There's not much else to say, besides that Gnatt is a kind and fun person to be around!  

Now, cirawakalong. I have significantly more to say about cira, and it's all good things. We're basically best friends, or at least I'd assume so. We talk to each other basically way more than anyone else (that even applies to his side somehow), and cirawakalong is literally the reason I started making music in the first place! WIthout him, I would not be the same person I am now. cira has honestly been such a major part of my life and I'm glad that we ever became friends.  

Watcher, while not on Discord anymore, is also just fun! They're obsessed with writing like me, except they can write STOOOOORIES!!!! :O  
Just an absolute blast, and being by their side for the series Demi's Chaos is so much fun, I kid you not!  

___

Now, we're nearing the end of this big-ass bio. This second-final section will go through not frequently asked questions about me.  

Q: What is your birthday?  
A: On the 7th of November.

Q: Where were you born?  
A: Don't know why you need to know this, but Lithuania.

Q: What is your favourite game?  
A: A Dance of Fire and Ice, I have over 250 hours on it on Steam for a reason.

Q: Do you like horror games?  
A: It's less than I dislike horror games and more that I'm strict with what horror games I DO like. I'm typically fine with psychological horror, because those tend to have less jumpscares, which I don't like. I'm also tolerant of blood, gore, and somewhat disturbing imagery. Some certain levels of disturbing imagery may scar me imagery and give me nightmares the next night, though.  

Q: What's your favourite soda?  
A: Fanta Fruit Twist, no hesitance.  

Q: What kind of games do you like?  
A: Incrementals aka. number games, fast-paced platformers, sandboxes, sometimes puzzles, and bonus points if you have a level editor.  

Q: Do we have any other questions to ask?  
A: Absolutely not, and that concludes this section!  

___

I'm going to hope that you somehow enjoyed me yapping about myself. Hopefully I didn't spit out any (new) personal information about someone, especially if it's of me! Anyways, yeah. This is Dehy, out!
